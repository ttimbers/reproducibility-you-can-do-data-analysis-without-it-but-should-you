# Reproducibility: you can do data analysis without it, but should you?
Talk for JSM 2022  “Theory and methods of building successful data analyses” contributed session 

Reproducibility as defined by the National Academy of Sciences is reaching the same result given the same input, 
computational methods, and conditions. 
In the context of data analysis, commonly the input is the data, 
the computational methods are the code needed to do the data analysis,
and the conditions are commonly the programming languages, 
packages and operating system dependencies (as well as their specific versions)
needed to execute the code.
Data analysis can be, and often is, performed without recording and sharing one of more of these components -
resulting in an analysis that cannot be reproduced. 
Does this matter? What, if any, are the consequences of such a non-reproducible data analysis? 
And is ommitting one of the components of a reproducible data analysis "worse" than another?
This talk will discuss real-life examples of non-reproducible data analsyses and their consequences
in an attempt to illustrate the critical importance of reproducibility in data analysis.
