## What is **reproducibility**?

#### Reaching the same result given the same input, computational methods, and conditions<sup>1</sup>

<br>

*Where:*

input = data

computational methods = computer code

conditions = computational environment (e.g., programming language & itâ€™s dependencies)

This is distinct from **replicability**, 
which obtaining consistent results across studies 
aimed at answering the same scientific question, 
each of which has obtained its own data.<sup>1</sup>

## How does this fit in with a "Theory and Methods for Building Successful Data Analyses"?

Reproducible data analysis can "help" make an analysis successful by helping build "trust" in the analysis.
This trust is important for stakeholders, of whom the application of the analysis impacts.

For example, it can:

1. provide evidence that the results or product could be regenerated given the same input computational methods, and conditions

2. is transparent - a human can audit all steps taken during analysis

3. if also version controlled, there is also a complete record of how and why analysis decisions were made

## Levels that non-reproducible analysis can have an impact on 

- Data Scientist
- Organization
- Beyond (e.g., Society)

## Potential impacts on the Data Scientist

We asked graduate and undergraduate Data Scientists in training for real life stories of workflow challenges and failures they had faced in the past (either at school or on the job).

From the 76 stories we collected, three main themes emerged:

1.

2.

3.

2. Case 2

3. Case 3
